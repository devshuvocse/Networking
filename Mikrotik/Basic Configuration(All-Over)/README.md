A comprehensive GNS3 lab demonstrating the **minimum required configuration** for a Mikrotik router to achieve full network functionality ‚Äî using both **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** via **Winbox**.

This project simulates a **two-site Wide Area Network (WAN)** setup, featuring a **Head Office (HO)** connected to the internet and a **Branch Office (BO)** linked via a **point-to-point connection**.

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this lab is to provide a fully functional GNS3 topology that helps learners and professionals practice Mikrotik configuration using both:

1. **CLI (Command Line Interface)** ‚Äî for direct, hands-on configuration.
2. **GUI (Winbox)** ‚Äî for quick setup, monitoring, and verification.

## üöÄ Key Features & Configuration Topics

This project covers the following core networking concepts and configurations:

- **Dual-Site Topology:** Head Office (HO) and Branch Office (BO) Mikrotik routers.
- **Interface Renaming:** Custom port names (e.g., `ether1` ‚Üí `WAN1`, `ether2` ‚Üí `LAN2`).
- **Internet Access:** DHCP Client setup on the WAN interface (for dynamic internet IP).
- **NAT (Masquerade):** Enables LAN devices to access the internet through the HO router.
- **DHCP Server:** Automatic IP and DNS assignment for LAN clients.
- **Static Routing:** 
  - **Default Route:** For internet access.
  - **Inter-Site Static Route:** For communication between HO and BO.
- **Connectivity Verification:** `ping` tests to verify inter-site and internet connectivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup Steps

1. **Clone all of my Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/mikrotik-minimum-configuration-lab.git](https://github.com/devshuvocse/Networking.git

Open the Project in GNS3:


Locate and open the .gns3 project file inside the repository.


Verify Mikrotik Image:


Ensure the correct Mikrotik CHR image is linked to both routers.


Start the Devices:


Right-click the topology ‚Üí Start All Devices.


Access Routers:


CLI: Double-click routers in GNS3 to open the console.


GUI (Winbox): Use MAC or IP to connect via the Winbox tool.


Default Credentials:


Username: admin


Password: (blank) but I add "itbd" in both router.
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The tutorial sets a new password immediately for security.
